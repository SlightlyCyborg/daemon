# The daemeon project: An open source AI companion

## Goal: Make a loyal AI companion

## Current features:
* Alarms & timers that can say whatever you want them to say (Used for meditation, or checking to make sure you are on task).
* A voice activated YouTube player to play music without looking away from what you are doing.
* Hotkeys to turn the AI on and off.
* Ability to greet you when the AI sees your face after a period of time.
* Ability to read you your calendar
* Ability to tweet messages.
* A pushup counter (my favorite).
